		I wouldn't say fantasy is my favourite genre but I love the adventure it takes you on, whether the plot itself but also with the characters.

		</p>
		<p> There aren't many standolone fantasy novels so finding this book was a blessing. I can't really deal with fantasy books because of the 
		long and intense world building that sometimes is the whole book so this book really was refreshing. This book is great as a quick read for
		fantasy lovers in a slump who want something with a good plot, romance, found family trope, and a suberp main lead. (Read synopsis on Goodreads).

		<h3> The Infernal Devices Series by Cassandra Clare (<a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7171637-clockwork-angel"> Clockwork Angel </a>, <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10025305-clockwork-prince"> Clockwork Prince </a>, <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18335634-clockwork-princess"> Clockwork Princess </a>) </h3>

		<p>
		This book has kept me in a chokehold for the past 2 years. About every week I remember this series and want so badly to experience 
		reading it for the first time again. It really is a shame that The Mortal Instruments were created by the same author but I find
		that it was totally worth it to reac the first half of that series to perfectly understand this one. (Read synopsis on Goodreads).

		By far my most favourite genre of fiction, mystery is always delightful to read no matter if its to do with murder

		<h3> Stalking Jack the Ripper Series by Kerri Maniscalco (<a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40727470-stalking-jack-the-ripper?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=0cXeTR3DAA&rank=1">

		<p>
		If you're a historical fiction and mystery lover like me then you'd love this series. These books will leave you satisfied after each read 
		with it's some-what predictable but greatly written plot twists but will have you coming back for more. (Read synopsis on Goodreads).

		<h3> One of Us is Lying Series (<a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58679358-one-of-us-is-lying?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=neqE6tBRKK&rank=1"> One of Us is Lying </a>,

		<p><img src = "OouiL.jpg" alt= "One of Us is Lying and One of Us is Next book covers"/>
		</p>
		<p> I wouldn't say the best part of this series is the mystery (yes, I know this is litterly in the best read mysteries section) because
		frankly that part didn't really seem intresting nor unpredictable. The true reason that this book gets all the hype is because of 
		the characters, more specifically the romance between them.

		<h3> Killing November Duology (<a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35053980-killing-november?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=2XhGOws6cB&rank=1">

		<h2 id = "Dystopian"> Dystopian </h2>
		<p>
		Dystopian isn't a genre I read a lot about, nothing against it, it's just sometimes that I'm never really in the mood to read one. But 
		these books have definetly put a smile on my face from time to time. 
		</p>
		<h3> Legend Series by Marie Lu (<a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9275658-legend?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=vNaOLqYogh&rank=1"> Legend </a>
		, <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13414446-prodigy"> Prodigy </a>, <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290364-champion"> Champion </a>,
		<a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42121526-rebel?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Mcek7ukYdH&rank=5"> Rebel </a>) </h3>
		<p><img src= "Legend-series.png" width = "500" height = "450" alt= "Legend, Prodigy, Champion, Rebel book covers"/>
		</p>
		<p> By far my favourite dystopian series in the world, Legend is an amazingly written and loveable series. From the characters to 
		the plot and world itself, this series has everything you could ask for in a dystopian. (Read synopsis on Goodreads).
		<h3> <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34649348-the-marrow-thieves?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=kHyrjzgzlm&rank=1">
		The Marrow Thieves </a> by Cherie Dimaline </h3>
		<p><img src= "tMT.jpg" width = "250" height = "375" alt= "The Marrow Thieves book cover"/>
		</p>
		<p> Even if this book was something I had to read for class, this book is a great, short read that not only entertains but brings 
		awareness to the mistreatment and oppresion of Indeginous people in Canada. (Read synopsis on Goodreads).
